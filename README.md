# AI Agent Project

## Overview
This project implements an AI agent using Python, designed to interact with users and generate responses based on their input. The agent leverages pre-trained models to provide intelligent replies.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-ai-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the AI agent, execute the following command:
```
python src/agent.py
```

## Capabilities
The AI agent can:
- Process user input and generate contextually relevant responses.
- Utilize a pre-trained AI model for generating replies.
- Clean and format user input for better understanding.
